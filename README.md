In this homework activity, I was tasked with building a prototype dashboard.The goal of this dashboard is to provide charts, maps, and interactive visualizations that help customers explore the data and determine if they want to invest in rental properties in San Francisco.


### 1 - Rental Analysis

In this part, I worked out all of the calculations and visualizations in [the analysis notebook](https://github.com/arzuisiktopbas/python-homework/blob/main/Homework%235/rental_analysis.ipynb).

### 2 - Dashboard

I have worked out all of the code and analysis that I found in part 1 to build the interactive dashboard for all of the visualizations. I used the Panel Library.

My results are rendered in the notebook, and the code is usable as long as it is in the pyviz environment. Additionally, in order to launch this app as a server outside of the notebook, I used the relevant object .servable().  My local browser opens a separate window with the serveable object ready when someone uses the pn.serve(), just like the gif.(below)
